"""
1. List can make some change. And Tuple can't make change. So Tuple is safer than List, and list is very convenient.
2. Set is mutable, But items in set are immutable. And all items in set are unique.
Also, all items in dictionary are unique, but dictionary have 2 Column, so like this can enter the price of the product to use dictionary.
3. No, because some float in python can have some deviation, like I know this two are equal, but python say it is not equal.
4. Lambda function is very easy to uss, because the syntax of lambda function is easy than normal.
But we can use just only one times, so we don't need to write for names. Last one, we can pass function as an argument.
5. Multi-module program is have many python file, so I can write one part in one python document. SO I think we can just use it in one small program.
Multi-package program is have many python package, so I can write one part in one python packages, in one part, I write some programs in this parts.
And I Think multi-package program is better for one teams.
6. Recursive function:
def example(condition):
    if condition == 1:
        result = True
    else:
        result = False
    return result

print(example(1))
We use return to return the answer.
Drawbacks: If we use recursive function to do one big question mathematic, like the result of 80th number of Fibonacci,
use the recursive function to know this result is very slow.
7. We can makes some note in the program, like use #, and you can write : a is for all apple's number.
8. I think: The syntax of your program and the syntax of your statement to output. Can be readable, understandable,
because this is very important for teamwork, so, if it isn't understandable, your teams can't understand the program you
wrote. Also, the program must be fast and can did everything.
9. First: Write one welcome sentence. And write what do you want doing. And when he is finished, I will say Good buy.
10. The program is very neat. Aligned. Use the Comment. Thoughtful.
